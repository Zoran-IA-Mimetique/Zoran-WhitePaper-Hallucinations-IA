# White Paper Zoran — Hallucinations IA : Loi, Économie et Mimétisme

## Abstract
AI hallucinations are not a bug but a mathematical law. This paper analyzes their persistence and proposes Zoran’s ΔM11.3 rollback and GlyphNet as a way to transform uncertainty into confidence.

## Introduction
This white paper explores the structural inevitability of AI hallucinations and the economic incentives that maintain them...

## Methods
- Mathematical framing of token-by-token error propagation
- Benchmark evaluation analysis
- Case studies on rare events (dates of birth)

## Results
- Hallucination rate proportional to data sparsity
- Benchmarks penalize uncertainty → systemic guessing
- Economic preference for certainty

## Discussion
- Consumer AI vs. critical domains
- The real cost of errors vs. computational overhead
- Role of Zoran’s architecture

## Conclusion
Hallucinations are not accidents but systemic. Zoran redefines them into trust signals through ΔM11.3 rollback, EthicChain traceability, and GlyphNet compression.
